## Building and deploying

There are two options. One is to simply download the app [JAR file](http://repo.enonic.com/public/com/enonic/app/rss/1.0.0/rss-1.0.0.jar) and move it to the XP installation's `$XP_HOME/deploy` folder.

Or you can build this app with gradle. First, download the zip file of this repo. Unpack it locally. In the terminal, from the root of the project, type `./gradlew build`. On Windows, just type `gradlew build`. Next, move the JAR file from `build/libs` to your `$XP_HOME/deploy` directory. The SEO Meta Fields app will now be available to add to your websites through the Content Manager admin tool in Enonic XP.

If you are upgrading to a newer version of this app, make sure to remove the old version's JAR file from the `$XP_HOME/deploy` directory.
